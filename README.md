# KT Cooper
Hi! My name's KT. I'm an undergrad software engineering student studying full stack Java development. I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusion, but am still learning how to implement those principles in practice.
## About Me
### Professional
I've worked in a variety of creative fields up until relatively recently. I've done backstage work for operas and other live productions, hairdressing, graphic design, clowning for parties (I know how to make a variety of balloon sculptures and have painted many a child's face), gogo dancing, and other odd jobs here and there. All of this work has required relatively minimal education and have helped me save up to attend college debt-free.

My careers path has definitly been unconventional, but I see that as a strength. I believe having such a varied background provides me with pivotal insights into both enterprise and consumer needs. I have a strong passion for accessibility and inclusion, and have a track record to prove it. I've been a spearhead in accessibility advocacy throughout my career and plan to continue onward to assure that websites and applications are not just usable, but an enjoyable experience for all users.
### Personal
In my free time, I can be found listening to the latest extremely niche underground music (whether it's tasteful or not is another question), playing or running tabletop roleplaying games, and hosting or preparing for my weekly cult film double feature. I also pick up some odd tasks here and there, including but not limited to transcribing/translating centuries-old occult literature, developing and procuring props for various LARP events, cooking something experimental in the kitchen, or studying up on this, that, or the other.
## About This Site
