                    Hey there! I'm KT Cooper, your friendly neighborhood 
                    web developer with a dash of quirky and a sprinkle of 
                    enthusiasm. üåü
                </p>
                <p>
                    My web development journey has been a bit of a 
                    rollercoaster. It all started back in middle and high 
                    school when I first dipped my toes into the magical 
                    world of coding. But you know how life likes to take 
                    unexpected turns? I found myself working in a barbershop 
                    after beauty school, thinking about college and what I 
                    truly wanted to study. It was there that I realized web 
                    development was my calling, and I never looked back!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not your typical developer. I find joy in the entire 
                    web development process, from design and coding to problem-
                    solving. You could say I'm a bit of a masochist for those 
                    mind-bending coding puzzles. But what truly lights a fire 
                    in my heart? Accessibility engineering. üåç‚ôøÔ∏è
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm knee-deep in the world of full-stack 
                    development, specializing in Java frameworks. One of my 
                    passions is making the web a more inclusive space for 
                    everyone, and I hope to earn professional certifications 
                    in accessibility engineering down the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of projects, I'm the brains (and heart) behind 
                    some exciting web adventures. Ever heard of NEOTROPOLIS, 
                    the annual cyberpunk LARP event? I'm helping build its web 
                    presence! And on the side, I'm crafting a personal project 
                    packed with tools to make running games of PARANOIA XP a 
                    breeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive on bold and creative concepts, and I'm all about 
                    pushing the boundaries of design. But don't let that fool 
                    you‚ÄîI'm just as comfortable with minimalist designs, and 
                    I relish the unique challenges they bring, especially when 
                    it comes to creating accessible elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a quirky fact for you: I have a unique talent (or 
                    should I say quirk) of sleeping with my eyes open. If that's 
                    too creepy, you can always stick to the fun stuff‚ÄîI'm a massive 
                    nerd who's run TTRPG games in seven different systems!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future holds exciting possibilities. I'm on a mission to 
                    develop tools that make livestreaming and virtual entertainment 
                    more accessible for the deaf and blind. üåêüéÆ
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, as they say in the game industry, "Fail faster." 
                    It's all about learning and growing, one step at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, as you explore my portfolio, I'd like to welcome, and 
                    let's make some web magic together! üöÄ
